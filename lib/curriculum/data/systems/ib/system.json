  "assessmentPhilosophy": "IB assessment is criterion-referenced, meaning students are evaluated against fixed standards rather than against each other. Assessment combines external examinations (typically 70-80% of final grade) with internally assessed coursework (20-30%). The IB emphasizes developing students who can think critically, apply knowledge to new situations, and communicate ideas effectively. Questions often require extended responses demonstrating deep understanding rather than memorization.",
